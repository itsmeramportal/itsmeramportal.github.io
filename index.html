							<h2 class="heading3 text-uppercase">Background</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="col-xs-11 col-sm-11 info-detail">
							<p>
								Ram hails from Kotikalapudi, a remote hamlet near Addanki in Prakasam District of Andhra Pradesh. With an agricultural parentage and a very basic economic background, though belonging to a much respected community,  Ram worked strenuously for over three decades to reach his present stature of respect and renown.
							</p>
							<p>
								Having completed his intermediate in Addanki town, he later finished his Graduation in Arts at Andhra University and found government employment as an LDC in the Endowments Department. After a year of service, he found it to be least interesting and bereft of anything challenging. So, he quit and was offered a job as a Teleprinter in Andhra Jyothi, one of the leading Telugu Dailies of the time. Here he learnt the magic of drafting press reports under the supervision of his superior, Late Shri AVS, who later became a leading comedy actor in Telugu Film Industry.
							</p>
							<p>
								Ram’s drafting skills in Telugu were much appreciated, and he soon found himself promoted as a Staff Reporter. Within a few years he worked himself up with his brilliant skills and communication, and also later worked for the Indian Express, and the Times of India. During his tenure with all these newspapers, he developed excellent public relations with a number of politicians, bureaucrats, businessmen, film personalities, socialites and other celebrities. His Telugu drafts drew even the attention of the then CM of combined AP Shri N. Chandrababu Naidu and he was summoned for a one to one interaction with him on certain political matters.
							</p>
							<p>
								His press experience and his own unique way of interacting with people led him to become one of the most sought for consultants for various VIPs in the State. After having put in nearly fifteen years of experience in print media, he joined Lanco Group Chairman Shri Lagadapati Rajgopal, and worked with him as his personal advisor on various matters including political and corporate for over two years. He presently works with several VIPs and Corporates and also takes up independent assignments as a Business Consultant and Political Strategist.

							<h2 class="heading3 text-uppercase">Down the Memory Lane</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="col-xs-11 col-sm-11 info-detail">
							<p>
								After his primary schooling in the village itself, between his 5th and 10th Standards, he would walk each day from his village to the high school, which was about 4.5 kms, without even footwear, since they were not affordable by his parents.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the summer when the sands would be hot, students like him would use large leaves of trees to protect themselves from the hot earth, by running for some time, and when their feet would become hot, throw the leaves down and jump on them till they cooled down. This was one of the most trying childhood experiences he had. And then he had to cross the Gundlakamma River which was about one kilometre wide in chest deep water every day to reach school. These experiences in his formative years demonstrate his humility and understanding of the economic status of all due to which he helped governments reach out to the lowest income classes for improving their lives.
